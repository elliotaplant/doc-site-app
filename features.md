# Features to add to the UI

- User should be able to create a site from a google doc or google drive folder
  - Probably needs a "Create Site" button
    - should it be the same button for sites and pages?
      - NO
  - Both
    - Pops open google drive UI
  - After user selects site,
- Login
  - Maybe just a login with google thing?
  - Maybe start with username/pw. Sites aren't necessarily just google accounts
